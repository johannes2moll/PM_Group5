    "The advantage of calculating RUL directly is that it is a simple and straightforward approach. The disadvantage is that it is not very accurate. The advantage of calculating RUL based on the HI is that it is more accurate. The disadvantage is that it is more complex. When receiving test data, the process looks like this: 1. Preprocess the data (e.g. remove outliers, normalize the data, etc.) 2. Calculate the HI 3. Calculate the RUL based on the HI. We use regression to predict RUL.\n",
